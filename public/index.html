    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the department of Political Science at Stony Brook University. I am also the current lab manager for the Stony Brook <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cbpe/" target="_blank">Center for Behavioral Political Economy</a>.</p>

<p>I am primarily interested in individual and institutional responses to climate change. I study both public opinion and the behavioral political economy of individual risk and mitigation preferences using experimental evidence and formal modeling. I am also more generally interested in social dilemmas.</p>

      <p><strong>Mobilizing Mitigation: Overcoming the Social Dilemma of Climate Change</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Committee:</strong> Reuben Kline (Co-Chair), John Barry Ryan (Co-Chair), Andrew W. Delton, &amp; Yanna Krupnikov</p>

<p>In this series of papers I use a variety of methods to answer important questions related to climate change mitigation. Why do we cooperate (and fail to cooperate) with each other when overcoming the social dilemmas inherent in climate change mitigation? How do natural disasters shape mitigation policy preferences? How do citizens and environmentalists trade off between environmental conservation and climate change mitigation?</p>

<p><details>
  <summary><strong>Chapter 1: Conditional on what? Disentangling intention and equality motivations behind conditional cooperation</strong></summary></p>

<p>Why citizens engage in costly political participation is one of the most persistent puzzles in political science. They overcome collective action problems, for example by voting, turning out to protest, and paying the costs of climate change mitigation. Extensive work using public goods games show conditional cooperators, those who cooperate with other cooperators, are critical to overcoming such dilemmas, but we know very little about what motivates these cooperators. Are they swayed because they perceive those around them to have good intentions? Or are they driven by general concerns for equality? Using a novel incentivized experiment, I find positive intentions sustain conditional cooperation, not a desire to maintain an equitable distribution of resources. I use the results of this study to construct a novel model of conditional cooperation in N-player social dilemmas and discuss implications for research on political behavior.</p>

<p></details></p>

<p><details>
  <summary><strong>Chapter 2: The Paradox of Climate Concern: Declining Mitigation Support after Natural Disasters</strong></summary></p>

<p>Can people translate their personal experiences into policy preferences? In this chapter I focus on the case of exposure to natural disasters and believe in climate change. The existing literature suggests that experiencing a natural disaster briefly increases belief in climate change. However, less work examines how this change in believe affects support for specific mitigation policies. Leveraging Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Matthew as natural experiments, I find that exposure to hurricanes has no effect on belief in climate change, but that it significantly decreases support for a key mitigation technology: nuclear power. In current experiments in progress I will attempt to disentangle the mechanism driving decreased nuclear power support. I will test whether the decline in support is due a rational fear of nuclear plant damage in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, or if exposure to a low probability disaster like a hurricane makes people more concerned about other similar disasters like those associated with nuclear power. This work indicates that while personal experiences may help people update their beliefs, the path from personal experience to policy preferences is much more complex.</p>

<p></details></p>

<p><details>
  <summary><strong>Chapter 3: Who Are They Fighting For? The Principal-Agent Problem of Environmental Activism</strong></summary></p>

<p>For activists to overcome the problem of low political participation they must not only be able to affect policy change, but they must do so in a way that is consistent with the preferences of the communities they represent. This creates a principal-agent problem between those who hold an issue position and the activists who lobby for related policies. In this paper, I illustrate this principal-agent problem using the case of climate change mitigation. In this instance, the principals are those who support climate change mitigation policies but are not politically active, while the agents are environmentalists. In order for environmentalists to serve as effective agents for those who support climate change mitigation, three conditions must be met. First, there actually have to be individuals who identify as environmentalists. Second, these environmentalists must be mobilized and participate in politics. Finally, they need to advocate for climate change mitigation policies. Using both nationally representative survey results and experimental evidence from a student sample, I show that while environmentalists exist and are indeed politically active, they prioritize environmental conservation over climate change mitigation.</p>

Talbot M. Andrews, Andrew W. Delton, &amp; Reuben Kline<br/>
<em>Nature Climate Change, 2018</em></summary></p>

<p>Some technologies, such as solar or wind power, create certain but relatively small reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Others, such as carbon sequestration devices, have larger potential upsides, but a greater possibility of failure. Here we show using economic games that people will invest in high-risk high-reward technologies when more certain options will not be sufficient. Groups of players had to contribute enough to avoid a simulated climate change disaster. Players could defect, make a certain contribution or make a risky contribution with a high potential gain. Across four studies using both laboratory (n= 296 and n= 297) and online (n= 501 and n= 499) samples, we found that more players made riskier contributions when necessary targets could not be met otherwise, regardless of the magnitude of potential losses. These results suggest that individuals are willing to invest in risky technology when it is necessary to mitigate climate change.</p>

Talbot M. Andrews, Aaron W. Lukaszewski, Zachary L. Simmons, &amp; April Bleske-Recheck<br/>
<em>Evolution and Human Behavior, 2016</em></summary></p>

<p>Women&rsquo;s body attractiveness is influenced by specific anthropometric cues, including body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-stature ratio (WSR), and shoulder-to-waist ratio (SWR). Despite the existence of multiple functional hypotheses to explain these preferences, it remains unclear which cue-based inferences are most influential in regulating evaluations of women&rsquo;s body attractiveness. We argue that (i) the common link to the morphological cues that influence women&rsquo;s body attractiveness is that they all reliably indicate high reproductive value (as defined by youth and low parity); and (ii) ancestrally, selection pressures related to tracking between-women differences in reproductive value would have been among the strongest acting on adaptations for body evaluation. An empirical study then tested the resulting prediction that cue-based estimates of reproductive value function as powerful regulators of women&rsquo;s body attractiveness judgments. Subjects viewed standardized photos of women in swimsuits (with heads obscured), and were assigned to either estimate components of their reproductive value (age or number of offspring) or rate their attractiveness. Structural equation modeling revealed that a latent variable capturing estimated reproductive value was almost perfectly correlated with a latent variable capturing body attractiveness. Moreover, unique associations of women&rsquo;s BMI, WHR, and WSR with their body attractiveness were entirely mediated via estimated reproductive value. These findings provide strong support for the longstanding hypothesis that women&rsquo;s body attractiveness is primarily explained by cue-based estimates of reproductive value – expected future utility as a vehicle of offspring production.</p>

  <summary><strong>The political complexity of attack and defense</strong><br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Leonie Huddy, Reuben Kline, H. Hannah Nam, and Katherine Sawyer<br/>
<em>Forthcoming Commentary in Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em></summary></p>

<p>De Dreu and Gross’s distinction between attack and defense is complicated in real-world conflicts because competing leaders construe their position as one of defense, and power imbalances place status quo challengers in a defensive position. Their account of defense as vigilant avoidance is incomplete because it avoids a reference to anger which transforms anxious avoidance into collective and unified action.</p>

  <summary><strong>Making useful political decisions for others: Experiments on Strategic Social Preferences</strong><br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Andrew W. Delton, &amp; Reuben Kline<br/>
<em>Under Review</em></summary></p>

<p>Politics often involves making decisions on behalf of others. Will citizens make these decisions for others in ways that are useful? Classic models that assume citizens are narrowly self-interested suggest they will not. More recent models incorporating social preferences—the willingness of people to pay personal costs to benefit others—suggests people will help others, including through political activity. We extend these models using two experimental games which ask not just whether people will pay a cost on behalf of others, but whether they will do so in a way that is strategically useful. Our game simulates making decisions to prevent others from experiencing disaster. We find that players are not only generous but are strategically so: Players tended to choose in the way that furthers positive outcomes for others. Our experiments suggest social preferences can lead to useful political decisions on behalf of others.</p>

  <summary><strong>Cost Conflation and the Mitigation of Collective Risk</strong><br/>
Talbot M. Andrews &amp; John Barry Ryan<br/>
</summary></p>

<p>How do we best mobilize people to pay the costs of disaster prevention? Though
intuitively it makes sense to emphasize the damages associated with failed prevention, we find that this activates a novel heuristic, “cost conflation,” where people assume expensive problems require extensive solutions. Using both an incentivized experiment and formal modeling techniques, we find subjects engage in cost conflation. As a result, people fail to prevent smaller disasters and pay too much to prevent large disasters when cheap solutions exist. Further, overemphasizing disaster damages could undermine successful prevention because, under cost conflation, people may view these disasters as too big to solve.</p>

  <summary><strong>Who do you trust? Inefficiency Incentives in Climate Change Mitigation</strong><br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Andrew W. Delton, and Reuben Kline<br/>
</summary></p>

<p>Climate change is an extremely polarized issue in the United States, with leaders across the political spectrum sending very different messages about whether and how we should implement mitigation policies. Do citizens have the tools necessary to distinguish between helpful and unhelpful information about mitigation policies? Leaders have different incentives which constrain their support for or opposition to mitigation spending. Here we test whether citizens are sensitive to different institutions which may give leaders an incentive to misrepresent the cost of providing public goods like mitigation or disaster prevention. We use an incentivized experiment to do so, specifically using a modified collective risk social dilemma. In this public goods game, players must contribute enough money to prepare for an ongoing disaster. Leaders know the exact cost of damage prevention, and send signals to the other players about the cost. We show that people are sensitive to institutional differences: when leaders have a stake in inefficiency, citizens trust the leader less and contribute less to the public good. In the midst of bleak research on mitigation policy support, we provide optimistic evidence of people’s ability to differentiate between helpful and unhelpful information about mitigation policies</p>

<h2 id="pol-543-390-environmental-policy-and-politics">POL 543 &amp; 390: Environmental Policy and Politics</h2>

<p><em>Summer 2019 (Online, cross listed as a masters and undergraduate course)</em> <br/>
<em><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8u-ibXDk6rmTCDwv4Iul7b7XE0EyOnJ/view" target="_blank">Syllabus</a></em> <br/>
Environmental policy is one of the most important and contentious areas of politics today. In this course we will cover how environmental policy is made, what major federal policies exist today, and how policies relate to public opinion and individual behavior. Overall, by addressing these three topics, this course will give students the tools to understand and evaluate the complex environmental policymaking environment.</p>

The US Congress is, literally, the most powerful legislative body in the world. In fact, the US Congress has more authority over policy-making than the legislatures of most other democratic nations. What does this power mean for American democracy and what does this power mean for the policy process? In this course, we will consider the inner workings of Congress through three questions: What happens during Congressional elections? How do members legislate? And do outside forces have influence on Congressional politics?</p>
