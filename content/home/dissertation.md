In this series of papers I use a variety of methods to answer important questions related to climate change mitigation. Why do we cooperate (and fail to cooperate) with each other when overcoming the social dilemmas inherent in climate change mitigation? How do natural disasters shape mitigation policy preferences? How do citizens and environmentalists trade off between environmental conservation and climate change mitigation?

  <summary>**Chapter 1: Conditional on what? Disentangling intention and equality motivations behind conditional cooperation**</summary>

Why citizens engage in costly political participation is one of the most persistent puzzles in political science. They overcome collective action problems, for example by voting, turning out to protest, and paying the costs of climate change mitigation. Extensive work using public goods games show conditional cooperators, those who cooperate with other cooperators, are critical to overcoming such dilemmas, but what motivates these cooperators? Are they swayed because they perceive those around them to have good intentions? Or are they driven by general concerns for equality? Using a novel incentivized experiment, I find positive intentions sustain conditional cooperation, not a desire to maintain an equitable distribution of resources. I use the results of this study to construct a novel model of conditional cooperation in N-player social dilemmas and discuss implications for research on political behavior.

  <summary>**Chapter 2: The Paradox of Climate Concern: Declining Mitigation Support after Natural Disasters**</summary>

Can people respond to political shocks with appropriate policy preferences? I argue that citizens struggle to link their experiences with political shocks to appropriate political attitudes, unless this link is made explicit. Furthermore, I argue shocks don’t only force citizens to consider how to respond to the shock, but activate competing considerations with can lead to counterintuitive and counterproductive policy preferences. I focus on the case of exposure to natural disasters and belief in climate change. Leveraging Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Matthew as natural experiments, I find that exposure to hurricanes has no effect on belief in climate change, but that it significantly decreases support for a key mitigation technology: nuclear power. I then propose an experiment to disentangle the mechanism driving decreased nuclear power support, testing whether the decline in support is due a rational fear of nuclear plant damage in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, or if exposure to a low probability disaster like a hurricane makes people more concerned about other similar disasters like those associated with nuclear power. This work indicates that while personal experiences may help people update their beliefs, the path from personal experience to policy preferences is complex and undermined by other considerations activated by disasters.

  <summary>**Chapter 3: Who Are They Fighting For? The Principal-Agent Problem of Environmental Activism**</summary>

For activists to overcome the problem of low political participation they must not only be able to affect policy change, but they must do so in a way that is consistent with the preferences of the communities they represent. This creates a principal-agent problem between those who hold an issue position and the activists who lobby for related policies. In this paper, I illustrate this principal-agent problem using the case of climate change mitigation. In this instance, the principals are those who support climate change mitigation policies but are not politically active, while the agents are environmentalists. In order for environmentalists to serve as effective agents for those who support climate change mitigation, three conditions must be met. First, there actually have to be individuals who identify as environmentalists. Second, these environmentalists must be mobilized and participate in politics. Finally, they need to advocate for climate change mitigation policies. Using both nationally representative survey results and experimental evidence from a student sample, I show that while environmentalists exist and are indeed politically active, they prioritize environmental conservation over climate change mitigation.

  <summary>**Chapter 4: (Antisocial) Punishment is Equally Effective Across cultures**</summary>

A stable minority of individuals engage in antisocial punishment: inflicting costs on cooperators. Computational models suggest this undermines the evolution of cooperative strategies, and there appears to be massive cross-cultural variability in punishment behavior. Using data from existing work which conducted public goods games in industrialized countries throughout the world (Herrmann, Thöni, and Gächter 2008), I find this isn’t the case. Antisocial punishment is as effective as any other form of punishment in increasing cooperation. Furthermore, the relationship between how much someone cooperates and how much they are punished does not vary across cultures. Instead, this apparent variability is a downstream byproduct of variability in people’s willingness to cooperate. This suggests that future work should focus on why first order defectors are willing to engage in second order cooperation
