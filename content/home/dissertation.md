In this series of papers I use a variety of methods to answer important questions related to climate change mitigation. Why do we cooperate (and fail to cooperate) with each other when overcoming the social dilemmas inherent in climate change mitigation? How do natural disasters shape mitigation policy preferences? How do citizens and environmentalists trade off between environmental conservation and climate change mitigation?

  <summary>**Chapter 1: The Paradox of Climate Concern: Declining Mitigation Support after Natural Disasters** <br/>
*Under Review* </summary>

Can people respond to political shocks with appropriate policy preferences? Political shocks capture the attention of the public and encourage citizens to consider how to respond to the event. However, they also activate competing considerations which may lead to counterintuitive and counterproductive policy preferences. Here I focus on the case of exposure to natural disasters and support for climate change mitigation policies. Leveraging Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Matthew as natural experiments, I find that exposure to hurricanes has a limited effect on belief in climate change and general climate change mitigation. Unfortunately, exposure to these disasters significantly decreases support for a key mitigation technology: nuclear power. While personal experiences may help people update their beliefs, the path from personal experience to policy preferences is complex and undermined by other considerations activated by disasters.

  <summary>**Chapter 2: Conditional on what? Disentangling intention and equality motivations behind conditional cooperation**</summary>

Why citizens engage in costly political participation is one of the most persistent puzzles in political science. They overcome collective action problems, for example by voting and turning out to protest. Extensive work using public goods games show conditional cooperators, those who cooperate with other cooperators, are critical to overcoming such dilemmas. But we know little about what motivates these cooperators. Are they swayed because they perceive those around them to have cooperative intentions? Or are they driven by general concerns for equity? Using an incentivized experiment, I find that cooperative intentions sustain conditional cooperation rather than a desire to maintain an equitable distribution of resources. This suggests that in order to effectively motivate cooperation in domains such as turning out to vote, we should emphasize the number of people already successfully doing so.

  <summary>**Chapter 3: Who Are They Fighting For? The Principal-Agent Problem of Environmental Activism**</summary>

Activists have the potential to overcome the problem of low political participation. However, this creates a principal-agent problem that is exacerbated when activists identify and act on an issue that is distinct from the issue identified by the larger groups they represent. I illustrate this problem using the case of climate change mitigation. In this instance, the principals are those who support climate change mitigation policies but are not politically active, while the agents are environmentalists. In order for environmentalists to serve as effective agents, (1) there actually have to be individuals who identify as environmentalists, (2) environmentalists must be politically active, and (3) environmentalists need to advocate for climate change mitigation policies. Using a novel scale to identify environmentalists, I find that environmentalists exists and are politically active. However, instead of prioritizing the problem of climate change, they prioritize environmental conservation.

  <summary>**Chapter 4: (Antisocial) Punishment is Equally Effective Across cultures**<br/>
*Revise & Resubmit*

</summary>

A stable minority of individuals engage in antisocial punishment: inflicting costs on cooperators. Computational models suggest this undermines the evolution of cooperative strategies, and there appears to be massive cross-cultural variability in punishment behavior. Using data from existing work which conducted public goods games in industrialized countries throughout the world (Herrmann, Thöni, and Gächter 2008), I find this isn’t the case. Antisocial punishment is as effective as any other form of punishment in increasing cooperation. Furthermore, the relationship between how much someone cooperates and how much they are punished does not vary across cultures. Instead, this apparent variability is a downstream byproduct of variability in people’s willingness to cooperate. This suggests that future work should focus on why first order defectors are willing to engage in second order cooperation.
