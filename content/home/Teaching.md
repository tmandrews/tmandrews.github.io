## POL 543 & 390: Environmental Policy and Politics
*Summer 2019 & 2020 <br/>
(Online, cross listed as a masters and undergraduate course)* <br/>
*[Syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8u-ibXDk6rmTCDwv4Iul7b7XE0EyOnJ/view)* <br/>
Environmental policy is one of the most important and contentious areas of politics today. In this course we will cover how environmental policy is made, what major federal policies exist today, and how policies relate to public opinion and individual behavior. Overall, by addressing these three topics, this course will give students the tools to understand and evaluate the complex environmental policymaking environment.

The US Congress is, literally, the most powerful legislative body in the world. In fact, the US Congress has more authority over policy-making than the legislatures of most other democratic nations. What does this power mean for American democracy and what does this power mean for the policy process? In this course, we will consider the inner workings of Congress through three questions: What happens during Congressional elections? How do members legislate? And do outside forces have influence on Congressional politics?
