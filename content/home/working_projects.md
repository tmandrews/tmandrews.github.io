  <summary>**Cost Conflation and the Mitigation of Collective Risk**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews & John Barry Ryan<br/>
*Under Review*
</summary>

How do we best mobilize people to pay the costs of disaster prevention? Thoughintuitively it makes sense to emphasize the damages associated with failed prevention, we find that this activates a novel heuristic, “cost conflation,” where people assume expensive problems require extensive solutions. Using both an incentivized experiment and formal modeling techniques, we find subjects engage in cost conflation. As a result, people fail to prevent smaller disasters and pay too much to prevent large disasters when cheap solutions exist. Further, overemphasizing disaster damages could undermine successful prevention because, under cost conflation, people may view these disasters as too big to solve.

  <summary>**When Trust Matters: The Case of Gun Control**<br/>
Tracy Goodwin, John Barry Ryan, Talbot M. Andrews, & Yanna Krupnikov<br/>
*Under Review*</summary>

Declining trust in government is often cited as the cause of declining support for policies that require ideological sacrifices. At the same time, whether trust in government affects attitudes in a particular issue area is conditional on the political context and can vary over time. We argue and show that when political parties polarize on an issue, then individuals who do not trust the government fear the “slippery slope”. Trust in government affects public policy attitudes when individuals believe small ideological costs now could be the beginning of a process that leads to large ideological costs later. We test the argument on the case of gun control using two datasets. We first show that trust in government affects conservatives’ gun control attitudes as polarization increases over the issue. We then use a continuum of gun control policies to demonstrate that fear of the slippery slope is the mechanism explaining why trust matters.

  <summary>**Rebel Recruitment in Civil Conflict**<br/>
Katherine Sawyer & Talbot M. Andrews<br/>
*Under Review*</summary>

While the conflict literature has examined the use of forced recruitment and child soldering, the question remains why groups would chose to do so when forced recruits require expensive coercion (Eck 2014) and time intensive socialization processes (Gates 2017). The prevailing wisdom in the literature is that forced recruitment is a tactic of the weak (Eck 2014); yet empirically, we often observe relatively strong rebel groups employing forced recruitment (Gates 2017). We resolve this disparity by developing a unified formal model of recruitment that matches the individual’s talent and utility for fighting with that of the rebel group’s. Critically, the model demonstrates that forced recruitment is not a tactic of last resort, but rather a method used by strong rebel groups who can credibly threaten defectors. The formal model is supported quantitatively and qualitatively using cross-national data on rebel recruitment practices (Cohen 2013) and case illustrations of the contras in Nicaragua and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador. The results speak to the growing literature emphasizing the importance of integrating individual and group level processes both theoretically and empirically.

  <summary>**Contextual Constraints on Discussion Partner Choice and Correct Voting**<br/>
John Barry Ryan & Talbot M. Andrews<br/>
*Under Review*<br/>
</summary>

Using a group based experiment, we demonstrate how contextual constraints in discussion partner choice can aid the efficacy of discussion as an information shortcut. Previous research has shown that political agreement is more important than expertise when individuals seek to use discussion as an information shortcut. In contrast, individuals typically place more weight on expertise than disagreement when choosing political discussion partners. As a result, the efficacy of political discussion improves when the supply of discussion partners is constrained to likeminded individuals. In effect, this prevents individuals from choosing a knowledgeable discussion partner who may provide biased information that misleads the individual. Ultimately these constraints result in more accurate information sharing and more individual-level correct voting when individuals are sorted into neighborhoods based on political preference. Further, the electorate’s preferred candidate – typically the less extreme candidate – is more likely to win when voters are sorted into ideologically distinct neighborhoods.

  <summary>**Making useful political decisions for others: Experiments on Strategic Social Preferences**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Andrew W. Delton, & Reuben Kline<br/>
*Under Review*<br/>
</summary>

Politics often involves making decisions on behalf of others. Will citizens make these decisions for others in ways that are useful? Classic models that assume citizens are narrowly self-interested suggest they will not. More recent models incorporating social preferences—the willingness of people to pay personal costs to benefit others—suggests people will help others, including through political activity. We extend these models using two experimental games which ask not just whether people will pay a cost on behalf of others, but whether they will do so in a way that is strategically useful. Our game simulates making decisions to prevent others from experiencing disaster. We find that players are not only generous but are strategically so: Players tended to choose in the way that furthers positive outcomes for others. Our experiments suggest social preferences can lead to useful political decisions on behalf of others.

  <summary>**Who do you trust? Inefficiency Incentives in Climate Change Mitigation**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Andrew W. Delton, & Reuben Kline<br/>
</summary>

Climate change is an extremely polarized issue in the United States, with leaders across the political spectrum sending very different messages about whether and how we should implement mitigation policies. Do citizens have the tools necessary to distinguish between helpful and unhelpful information about mitigation policies? Leaders have different incentives which constrain their support for or opposition to mitigation spending. Here we test whether citizens are sensitive to different institutions which may give leaders an incentive to misrepresent the cost of providing public goods like mitigation or disaster prevention. We use an incentivized experiment to do so, specifically using a modified collective risk social dilemma. In this public goods game, players must contribute enough money to prepare for an ongoing disaster. Leaders know the exact cost of damage prevention, and send signals to the other players about the cost. We show that people are sensitive to institutional differences: when leaders have a stake in inefficiency, citizens trust the leader less and contribute less to the public good. In the midst of bleak research on mitigation policy support, we provide optimistic evidence of people’s ability to differentiate between helpful and unhelpful information about mitigation policies
