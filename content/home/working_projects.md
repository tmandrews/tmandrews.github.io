  <summary>**Cost Conflation and the Mitigation of Collective Risk**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews & John Barry Ryan<br/>
*Revise & Resubmit*
</summary>

How do we best mobilize people to pay the costs of disaster prevention? Though intuitively it makes sense to emphasize the damages associated with failed prevention, we find that this activates a novel heuristic, “cost conflation,” where people assume expensive problems require extensive solutions. Using both an incentivized experiment and formal modeling techniques, we find subjects engage in cost conflation. As a result, people fail to prevent smaller disasters and pay too much to prevent large disasters when cheap solutions exist. Further, overemphasizing disaster damages could undermine successful prevention because, under cost conflation, people may view these disasters as too big to solve.

  <summary>**Who do you trust? Inefficiency Incentives in Climate Change Mitigation**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Andrew W. Delton, & Reuben Kline<br/>
*Under Review*
</summary>

Climate change is an extremely polarized issue in the United States, with leaders across the political spectrum sending very different messages about whether and how we should implement mitigation policies. Do citizens have the tools necessary to distinguish between helpful and unhelpful information about mitigation policies? Leaders have different incentives which constrain their support for or opposition to mitigation spending. Here we test whether citizens are sensitive to different institutions which may give leaders an incentive to misrepresent the cost of providing public goods like mitigation or disaster prevention. We use an incentivized experiment to do so, specifically using a modified collective risk social dilemma. In this public goods game, players must contribute enough money to prepare for an ongoing disaster. Leaders know the exact cost of damage prevention, and send signals to the other players about the cost. We show that people are sensitive to institutional differences: when leaders have a stake in inefficiency, citizens trust the leader less and contribute less to the public good. In the midst of bleak research on mitigation policy support, we provide optimistic evidence of people’s ability to differentiate between helpful and unhelpful information about mitigation policies

  <summary>**Making useful political decisions for others: Experiments on Strategic Social Preferences**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Andrew W. Delton, & Reuben Kline<br/>
*Under Review*<br/>
</summary>

Politics often involves making decisions on behalf of others. Will citizens make these decisions for others in ways that are useful? Classic models that assume citizens are narrowly self-interested suggest they will not. More recent models incorporating social preferences—the willingness of people to pay personal costs to benefit others—suggests people will help others, including through political activity. We extend these models using two experimental games which ask not just whether people will pay a cost on behalf of others, but whether they will do so in a way that is strategically useful. Our game simulates making decisions to prevent others from experiencing disaster. We find that players are not only generous but are strategically so: Players tended to choose in the way that furthers positive outcomes for others. Our experiments suggest social preferences can lead to useful political decisions on behalf of others.

  <summary>**Too Many Ways to Help: How to Promote Climate Change Mitigation Behaviors**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews, Reuben Kline, Yanna Krupnikov, & John Barry Ryan <br/>
*Under Review*<br/>
</summary>

What are the most effective messages to mobilize people to engage in climate change mitigation behaviors? One common strategy is to tell individuals about many easy ways they can get involved. However, psychological theories of choice suggest this communication strategy might backfire: when presented with too many options, people become less likely to make any choice at all. Here we conduct a two-wave survey experiment to see if a similar phenomenon occurs with regards to mitigation. In the first wave, we randomly assigned subjects to see messages encouraging either 1, 5, 10, or 20 pro-environmental behaviors drawn from a set which was pre-tested to get a rating of how difficult they were to carry out. Consistent with a theory we call “mitigation overload”, we find that subjects who saw a message suggesting 20 easy ways they could engage in climate change mitigation felt less efficacious. One week later, these subjects also reported engaging in fewer mitigation behaviors compared to those who saw fewer ways to mitigate. But, introducing more difficult items to the list alleviated mitigation overload and increased efficacy. These results suggest more isn’t always better when communicating ways individuals can help stop climate change.

  <summary>**Climate Change Literacy in Africa**<br/>
Nicholas Philip Simpson, Talbot M. Andrews, Matthias Kronke, Christopher Lennard, Romaric C. Odoulami, Birgitt Ouweneel, Anna Steynor, & Christopher H. Trisos<br/>
*Under Review*
</summary>

Climate change literacy is defined as being both aware of climate change and its anthropogenic causes, and thus underpins informed mitigation and adaptation responses. However, climate change literacy rates and their predictors remain poorly understood across the Global South. Here, we analysed Africa’s largest, representative public opinion survey to quantify change literacy rates. Climate change literacy ranges from 23–66% of the population across 33 countries, with larger variation at subnational scales (e.g., 5–71% among states in Nigeria). Strong positive predictors of climate change literacy are education and mobility, but poverty decreases climate change literacy and women are less likely to be climate change literate than men. Perceived drought experiences and historical trends in precipitation are also important predictors. These results highlight where services can target specific regions and demographics to increase climate change literacy and help ensure adaptation responses are informed by better understandings of future climate change.

  <summary>**The road to reelection is paved with good intentions: Experiments on the role of outcomes and intentions in voting behavior**<br/>
Talbot M. Andrews & Scott Bokemper <br/>
*Under Review*<br/>
</summary>

Politicians signal their intended policy outcomes to voters, such through campaign promises. However, theories of retrospective voting suggest these intentions don’t impact vote choice – so why do politicians spend resources on signaling their intentions? Here, we propose an outcome-intention theory of voting in which voters weigh both policy outcomes and intentions in their choice between candidates. We conducted four incentivized experiments using a novel election game. In these experiments, participants took the role of voters who experienced a better or worse policy enacted by an incumbent and then decided whether to reelect the incumbent or vote in a challenger. We manipulated whether the voters knew whether the incumbent intended to enact the outcome that voters experienced. Across all four experiments, we found intentions matter. Voters rewarded incumbents who purposefully enacted good outcomes and forgave incumbents for bad outcomes that were not intended.

  <summary>**Contextual Constraints on Discussion Partner Choice and Correct Voting**<br/>
John Barry Ryan & Talbot M. Andrews<br/>
</summary>

Using a group based experiment, we demonstrate how contextual constraints in discussion partner choice can aid the efficacy of discussion as an information shortcut. Previous research has shown that political agreement is more important than expertise when individuals seek to use discussion as an information shortcut. In contrast, individuals typically place more weight on expertise than disagreement when choosing political discussion partners. As a result, the efficacy of political discussion improves when the supply of discussion partners is constrained to likeminded individuals. In effect, this prevents individuals from choosing a knowledgeable discussion partner who may provide biased information that misleads the individual. Ultimately these constraints result in more accurate information sharing and more individual-level correct voting when individuals are sorted into neighborhoods based on political preference. Further, the electorate’s preferred candidate – typically the less extreme candidate – is more likely to win when voters are sorted into ideologically distinct neighborhoods.
