I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the department of Political Science at Stony Brook University. I am also the current lab manager for the Stony Brook [Center for Behavioral Political Economy](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cbpe/). 

I am primarily interested in individual and institutional responses to climate change. I study both public opinion and the behavioral political economy of individual risk and mitigation preferences using experimental evidence and formal modeling. I am also more generally interested in social dilemmas.
