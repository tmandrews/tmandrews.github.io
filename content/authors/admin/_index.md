My work focuses on how institutions, public policy, and the physical environment shape preferences and behavior related to climate change. I use a combination of experiments, public opinion data, and formal theory to answer questions such as: When do people believe in climate change? When are they willing to support climate change mitigation policies? How do we govern emerging technologies (e.g., geoengineering) in the context of climate change? I am also more broadly interested in political behavior, and how public opinion is shaped by disasters.

I am an assistant professor in the department of political science at the [University of Connecticut](https://polisci.uconn.edu/person/talbot-andrews/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University in the [Center for the Study of Democratic Politics](https://csdp.princeton.edu/). I earned my PhD in the department of Political Science at Stony Brook University in August of 2020.
